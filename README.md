1) The robot opens the software OrderSystems.exe.
2) In the first screen of the software, he writes the login and password and presses the button and the robot is logged on the system.
3) The robot gets data from a excel file and writes this data on OrderSystems.exe.
4) Each time he writes the data and presses the confirm button, a order is confirmed.
5) The excel file has many orders, so the robot will do the step 3 x times, where x is the number of orders in the excel file. 
6) After the robot makes all the orders in OrderSystems.exe, the software is closed and the process is completed.
